## 📌 Strategic Questions 
### **1️⃣  What factors are driving changes in profit margins across different regions?**
   - **Descriptive:** What are the profit trends across regions over the years?
     
        The trend analysis reveals significant regional profit variations, with the West and East outperforming the South and Central regions. California leads in profitability, while states with higher discounts, like Texas and Illinois, report lower profits. Conversely, states like New York and Pennsylvania, with controlled discounts, achieve profitability closer to California. This highlights the crucial balance between discounting and profit optimization. 
   - **Predictive:** Can regional sales and discounts predict future profit margins??

      The analysis shows that higher discounts in regions like the South and Central lead to lower profits, while balanced discounting in California and New York results in healthier margins. States like Texas and Illinois, with excessive discounts, see reduced profitability, whereas strong Technology sales in the West drive higher predicted margins. This highlights the need to optimize sales volume and discounts for better profitability.
   - **Prescriptive:** What strategies should be implemented to improve profits in low-performing regions??

     To improve low-performing regions, limiting discounts below 15% in the South and Central can boost profits. Aligning Texas and Illinois’ discount policies with high-performing states enhances margins. Targeting high-value customers and implementing region-specific pricing further drive profitability.

### **2️⃣ 	How do profit and shipping times vary across different states, and how can we improve them?**
   - **Descriptive:** What are the average shipping times for each shipping mode in different states?

      Shipping time trends show that **Standard Class** has the longest average duration (4.5 days), followed by **Second Class (3 days)**, **First Class (2 days)**, and **Same Day (less than a day)**. States like **Wyoming, Montana, and North Dakota** face longer shipping times, leading to lower customer satisfaction and reduced profits, whereas **California and New York** have shorter durations. Despite **Standard Class** being the most used shipping mode, it does not directly translate to higher profitability.
   - **Predictive:** What patterns and correlations can be identified between shipping modes, shipping times, and sales?

     Predictive analytics reveal that faster shipping modes, like **First Class**, drive higher profitability despite their costs, while **Standard Class** leads in sales volume but yields lower profits due to longer shipping times. Scatter plot analysis shows a stronger profit correlation with **First Class**, emphasizing its higher margin. States with long **Standard Class** delivery times face dissatisfied customers and lower repeat sales. Shipments exceeding **5 days** result in diminishing returns, highlighting the need to balance **speed and cost-effectiveness** in shipping strategies.
   - **Prescriptive:** What logistics improvements can be made to optimize shipping times and increase profits?

     To enhance shipping efficiency and profitability, **faster modes like Same Day and First Class** should be prioritized for high-value customers in key states like **California and Texas**. **Strategic warehousing** in high-demand regions and **route optimization** can reduce delays, especially for **Standard Class** in states like **Wyoming and Montana**. A **segmented shipping strategy** ensures corporate clients get faster options, while real-time **monitoring and analytics** streamline logistics and improve customer satisfaction.

### **3️⃣ 	How can we improve sales performance in states with less sales, considering factors like shipping duration and customer segments?**
   - **Descriptive:** What states are showing less sales?

     The **sales map analysis** reveals that states like **Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Maine, West Virginia, and D.C.** have consistently **low sales** compared to high-performing states like **California and New York**. These states rely heavily on the **Consumer segment**, with minimal contributions from **Corporate and Home Office** customers, indicating underutilization of high-value groups. Additionally, **prolonged shipping times** in these regions may further impact **customer satisfaction and retention**. 
   - **Predictive:** Can improving shipping durations boost future sales performance?

     The **scatter plot analysis** reveals that **shipping duration is not a key factor** in low-performing states' poor sales. Instead, high-performing states like **California** have a **balanced distribution** of sales across **Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office segments**, while low-sales states rely heavily on the **Consumer segment**. This suggests that **improving customer segmentation strategies** rather than shipping speed would be more effective in boosting sales in these regions.
   - **Prescriptive:** What strategies can boost sales in these states?

     To boost sales in low-performing states, focus on **Corporate and Home Office segments** through **targeted marketing, bulk discounts, and localized campaigns**. Partner with **local businesses** for corporate discounts and adjust pricing strategies to attract high-value customers. Prioritize **high-margin products like Technology and Office Supplies** while implementing **loyalty programs and exclusive offers** to enhance customer retention and long-term growth.
